<h1>About me</h1>
<p>My name is Nicole. I am currently living in Southern California. I am blessed with two wonderful children, a daughter and son. </p>

<p>I left China in 1995. I have lived and worked in 4 countries so far. <br>
    They are: <br>
    <ul>
        <li>China</li>
        <li>Singapore</li>
        <li>Canada</li>
        <li>US</li>
    </ul>

<p>I am going to use this webside to document the life I have been blessed with, including blessings, the mistakes I have made, the sufferings.</p>
